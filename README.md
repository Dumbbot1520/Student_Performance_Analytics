# Student_Performance_Analytics
End-to-end data analytics project analyzing student performance using Python, SQL (MySQL), and Power BI. The project focuses on data cleaning, outlier handling, exploratory analysis, and building an interactive dashboard to evaluate academic performance, equity gaps, and the impact of test-preparation interventions.

## Project Overview -

This project focuses on analyzing student academic performance using a structured, industry-oriented data analytics workflow.  
It covers data cleaning and validation using Python, exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL in MySQL, and interactive dashboard development in Power BI.

The goal of the project is to evaluate overall student performance, identify performance gaps, assess the impact of academic interventions, and demonstrate practical skills in Python, SQL, and business intelligence reporting.

## Project Files -

- **StudentsPerformance_irregular.csv** – Raw student performance dataset  
- **data_cleaning.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning, outlier handling, and feature engineering  (you need to import the cleaned dataset or connect directly to MySQL or PostgreSQL after cleaning)
- **SQL_EDA.sql** – SQL queries used for exploratory data analysis in MySQL  
- **student_analytics.pbix** – Power BI dashboard visualizing student performance insights  

---

## Tools & Technologies Used -

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – Data cleaning, validation, feature engineering , outlier handling 
- **MySQL** – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard and data visualization

## Project Workflow -

### Data Loading
- Loaded the raw student performance dataset from CSV format.

### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Standardized column names and categorical values.
- Handled missing values and removed invalid records.
- Identified and removed outlier values using domain-based validation.
- Created derived features such as average score and performance categories.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed SQL-based EDA in MySQL.
- Analyzed performance trends across subjects, gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation.
- Evaluated academic performance distribution and variability.

### Data Visualization
- Connected MySQL to Power BI.
- Built an interactive dashboard using business-focused KPIs and measures.
- Designed visuals to highlight performance trends, equity gaps, and intervention impact.
